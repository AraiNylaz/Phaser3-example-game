Phaser3 game template example
=============================

This is a [Phaser3](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser) game template, a bare minimum game example.
It is intended to show the structure of a typical Phaser3 game,
and using some of the key features of Phaser.

All the important features needed to create a game in Phaser v3.
It's not an actual game but it's a starting point, a code template.

This JavaScript game example shows:

* Using different scenes
* A loading bar
* Sprite atlas loading
* Sprite animation
* Buttons similar to Phaser v2
* Bitmaptext
* Keyboard input
* Mouse/touch input
* Arcade overlap/collige
* Sound effects

Still missing:

* Scaling or a scalemanager
